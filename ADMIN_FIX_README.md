# Admin Dashboard Create Button Fix

## Issue
The "Create" buttons in the admin dashboard for adding new courses and assignments were not working because:
1. The form submission handlers were disabled/commented out
2. Database policies didn't allow authenticated users to create courses and assignments
3. The form data structure didn't match the database schema

## Fix Applied

### 1. Form Submission Handlers
- Implemented complete form submission logic for both course and assignment creation
- Added proper form validation
- Added loading states and error handling
- Added success feedback and form reset functionality

### 2. Database Schema Alignment
- Updated the form submission to match the actual database schema
- Courses now include: title, description, language, level, duration_hours, instructor_id, is_active
- Assignments now include: course_id, title, description, assignment_type, difficulty_level, max_score, due_date, is_active

### 3. Database Policies
- Created new migration file: `database/migrations/005_add_admin_policies.sql`
- Added policies to allow authenticated users to create, read, update, and delete courses and assignments

## How to Apply the Fix

### Step 1: Apply Database Migration
Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the contents of database/migrations/005_add_admin_policies.sql
```

Or manually run:

```sql
-- Add policy for authenticated users to create courses
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can create courses" ON public.courses;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create courses" ON public.courses
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Add policy for authenticated users to create assignments
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can create assignments" ON public.assignments;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can create assignments" ON public.assignments
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow authenticated users to view all courses and assignments for admin dashboard
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view all courses" ON public.courses;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view all courses" ON public.courses
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view all assignments" ON public.assignments;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can view all assignments" ON public.assignments
    FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Allow authenticated users to update and delete courses and assignments
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can manage courses" ON public.courses;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can manage courses" ON public.courses
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can delete courses" ON public.courses;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete courses" ON public.courses
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can manage assignments" ON public.assignments;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can manage assignments" ON public.assignments
    FOR UPDATE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can delete assignments" ON public.assignments;
CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can delete assignments" ON public.assignments
    FOR DELETE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
```

### Step 2: Test the Fix
1. Open the admin dashboard (`admin-dashboard.html`)
2. Make sure you're logged in to Supabase
3. Navigate to the "Courses" tab
4. Click "Add Course" button
5. Fill in the form (Title, Description, Level are required)
6. Click "Create" - you should see a success message
7. Repeat for "Assignments" tab

### Step 3: Verify Database
Check your Supabase dashboard to confirm that:
- New courses appear in the `courses` table
- New assignments appear in the `assignments` table

## Features Added
- Form validation for required fields
- Loading states during creation
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Success feedback
- Automatic form reset after successful creation
- Automatic refresh of the courses/assignments list

## Notes
- File upload functionality is prepared but currently stores empty arrays
- Default values are set for some fields (language: 'Spanish', duration: 10 hours, etc.)
- Course assignments will need to be linked manually via course_id field
- The instructor_id field is set to null and can be updated later

The create buttons should now work properly for adding new courses and assignments!
