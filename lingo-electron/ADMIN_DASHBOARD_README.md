# Lingo Admin Dashboard

This document explains how to access and use the Lingo Admin Dashboard for owners and teachers to manage courses and assignments.

## Overview

The Admin Dashboard is a dedicated interface separate from the student dashboard that allows administrators and teachers to:

- Manage courses and course content
- Create and manage assignments
- View student submissions and progress
- Generate grade reports
- Monitor system activity

## Access Methods

### Method 1: Electron App (Recommended)

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In the Electron app, navigate to the admin dashboard by:
   - Manually typing `/admin` in the address bar
   - Or accessing it through the admin login page

### Method 2: Standalone HTML Files

For quick access without the full Electron app:

1. **Admin Login**: Open `admin-login.html` in your browser
2. **Admin Dashboard**: Open `admin-dashboard.html` directly

## Authentication

### Demo Credentials

**Admin Account:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `admin123`

**Teacher Account:**
- Username: `teacher`
- Password: `teacher123`

> ⚠️ **Security Note**: These are demo credentials for development. In production, implement proper authentication with secure password hashing and user management.
